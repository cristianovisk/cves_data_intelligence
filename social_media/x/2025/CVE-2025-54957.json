        "description": "AN ISSUE WAS DISCOVERED IN DOLBY UDC 4.5 THROUGH 4.13. A CRASH OF THE DD+ DECODER PROCESS CAN OCCUR WHEN A MALFORMED DD+ BITSTREAM IS PROCESSED. WHEN EVOLUTION DATA IS PROCESSED BY EVO_PRIV.C FROM THE DD+ BITSTREAM, THE DECODER WRITES THAT DATA INTO A BUFFER. THE LENGTH CALCULATION FOR A WRITE CAN OVERFLOW DUE TO AN INTEGER WRAPAROUND. THIS CAN LEAD TO THE ALLOCATED BUFFER BEING TOO SMALL, AND THE OUT-OF-BOUNDS CHECK OF THE SUBSEQUENT WRITE TO BE INEFFECTIVE, LEADING TO AN OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE.",
