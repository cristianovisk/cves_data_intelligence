THE SUBSEQUENT TAIL-HANDLING CODE THEN OPERATES ON THE ORIGINAL<BR>BASE POINTERS, EFFECTIVELY REPROCESSING THE BEGINNING OF THE BUFFER WHILE<BR>LEAVING THE ACTUAL TRAILING BYTES UNPROCESSED. THE AUTHENTICATION CHECKSUM<BR>ALSO EXCLUDES THE TRUE TAIL BYTES.<BR><BR>HOWEVER, TYPICAL OPENSSL CONSUMERS USING EVP ARE NOT AFFECTED BECAUSE THE<BR>HIGHER-LEVEL EVP AND PROVIDER OCB IMPLEMENTATIONS SPLIT INPUTS SO THAT FULL<BR>BLOCKS AND TRAILING PARTIAL BLOCKS ARE PROCESSED IN SEPARATE CALLS, AVOIDING<BR>THE PROBLEMATIC CODE PATH. ADDITIONALLY, TLS DOES NOT USE OCB CIPHERSUITES.<BR>THE VULNERABILITY ONLY AFFECTS APPLICATIONS THAT CALL THE LOW-LEVEL<BR>CRYPTO_OCB128_ENCRYPT() OR CRYPTO_OCB128_DECRYPT() FUNCTIONS DIRECTLY WITH<BR>NON-BLOCK-ALIGNED LENGTHS IN A SINGLE CALL ON HARDWARE-ACCELERATED BUILDS.<BR>FOR THESE REASONS THE ISSUE WAS ASSESSED AS LOW SEVERITY.<BR><BR>THE FIPS MODULES IN 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 AND 3.0 ARE NOT AFFECTED<BR>BY THIS ISSUE, AS OCB MODE IS NOT A FIPS-APPROVED ALGORITHM.<BR><BR>OPENSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 AND 1.1.1 ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS ISSUE.<BR><BR>OPENSSL 1.0.2 IS NOT AFFECTED BY THIS ISSUE.",
