HOWEVER, THIS CVE EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF AFFECTED PACKAGES IN TWO WAYS. \n\nFIRST, WHILE THE ENTRYPOINT FOR THE VULNERABILITY WAS THE TIKA-PARSER-PDF-MODULE AS REPORTED IN CVE-2025-54988, THE VULNERABILITY AND ITS FIX WERE IN TIKA-CORE. USERS WHO UPGRADED THE TIKA-PARSER-PDF-MODULE BUT DID NOT UPGRADE TIKA-CORE TO >= 3.2.2 WOULD STILL BE VULNERABLE. \n\nSECOND, THE ORIGINAL REPORT FAILED TO MENTION THAT IN THE 1.X TIKA RELEASES, THE PDFPARSER WAS IN THE ORG.APACHE.TIKA:TIKA-PARSERS MODULE.",
