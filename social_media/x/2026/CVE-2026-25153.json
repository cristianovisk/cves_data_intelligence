        "description": "BACKSTAGE IS AN OPEN FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING DEVELOPER PORTALS, AND @BACKSTAGE/PLUGIN-TECHDOCS-NODE PROVIDES COMMON NODE.JS FUNCTIONALITIES FOR TECHDOCS. IN VERSIONS OF @BACKSTAGE/PLUGIN-TECHDOCS-NODE PRIOR TO 1.13.11 AND 1.14.1, WHEN TECHDOCS IS CONFIGURED WITH `RUNIN: LOCAL`, A MALICIOUS ACTOR WHO CAN SUBMIT OR MODIFY A REPOSITORYS `MKDOCS.YML` FILE CAN EXECUTE ARBITRARY PYTHON CODE ON THE TECHDOCS BUILD SERVER VIA MKDOCS HOOKS CONFIGURATION. @BACKSTAGE/PLUGIN-TECHDOCS-NODE VERSIONS 1.13.11 AND 1.14.1 CONTAIN A FIX. THE FIX INTRODUCES AN ALLOWLIST OF SUPPORTED MKDOCS CONFIGURATION KEYS. UNSUPPORTED CONFIGURATION KEYS (INCLUDING `HOOKS`) ARE NOW REMOVED FROM `MKDOCS.YML` BEFORE RUNNING THE GENERATOR, WITH A WARNING LOGGED TO INDICATE WHICH KEYS WERE REMOVED. USERS OF `@TECHDOCS/CLI` SHOULD ALSO UPGRADE TO THE LATEST VERSION, WHICH INCLUDES THE FIXED `@BACKSTAGE/PLUGIN-TECHDOCS-NODE` DEPENDENCY. SOME WORKAROUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. CONFIGURE TECHDOCS WITH `RUNIN: DOCKER` INSTEAD OF `RUNIN: LOCAL` TO PROVIDE CONTAINER ISOLATION, THOUGH IT DOES NOT FULLY MITIGATE THE RISK. LIMIT WHO CAN MODIFY `MKDOCS.YML` FILES IN REPOSITORIES THAT TECHDOCS PROCESSES; ONLY ALLOW TRUSTED CONTRIBUTORS. IMPLEMENT PR REVIEW REQUIREMENTS FOR CHANGES TO `MKDOCS.YML` FILES TO DETECT MALICIOUS `HOOKS` CONFIGURATIONS BEFORE THEY ARE MERGED. USE MKDOCS < 1.4.0 (E.G., 1.3.1) WHICH DOES NOT SUPPORT HOOKS. NOTE: THIS MAY LIMIT ACCESS TO NEWER MKDOCS FEATURES. BUILDING DOCUMENTATION IN CI/CD PIPELINES USING `@TECHDOCS/CLI` DOES NOT MITIGATE THIS VULNERABILITY, AS THE CLI USES THE SAME VULNERABLE `@BACKSTAGE/PLUGIN-TECHDOCS-NODE` PACKAGE.",
