        "description": "THE OWASP CORE RULE SET (CRS) IS A SET OF GENERIC ATTACK DETECTION RULES FOR USE WITH COMPATIBLE WEB APPLICATION FIREWALLS. PRIOR TO VERSIONS 4.22.0 AND 3.3.8, THE CURRENT RULE 922110 HAS A BUG WHEN PROCESSING MULTIPART REQUESTS WITH MULTIPLE PARTS. WHEN THE FIRST RULE IN A CHAIN ITERATES OVER A COLLECTION (LIKE `MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS`), THE CAPTURE VARIABLES (`TX:0`, `TX:1`) GET OVERWRITTEN WITH EACH ITERATION. ONLY THE LAST CAPTURED VALUE IS AVAILABLE TO THE CHAINED RULE, WHICH MEANS MALICIOUS CHARSETS IN EARLIER PARTS CAN BE MISSED IF A LATER PART HAS A LEGITIMATE CHARSET. VERSIONS 4.22.0 AND 3.3.8 PATCH THE ISSUE.",
