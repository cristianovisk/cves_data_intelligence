        "description": "RUFUS IS A UTILITY THAT HELPS FORMAT AND CREATE BOOTABLE USB FLASH DRIVES. VERSIONS 4.11 AND BELOW CONTAIN A RACE CONDITION (TOCTOU) IN SRC/NET.C DURING THE CREATION, VALIDATION, AND EXECUTION OF THE FIDO POWERSHELL SCRIPT. SINCE RUFUS RUNS WITH ELEVATED PRIVILEGES (ADMINISTRATOR) BUT WRITES THE SCRIPT TO THE %TEMP% DIRECTORY (WRITEABLE BY STANDARD USERS) WITHOUT LOCKING THE FILE, A LOCAL ATTACKER CAN REPLACE THE LEGITIMATE SCRIPT WITH A MALICIOUS ONE BETWEEN THE FILE WRITE OPERATION AND THE EXECUTION STEP. THIS ALLOWS ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION WITH ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGES. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN FIXED IN VERSION 4.12_BETA.",
