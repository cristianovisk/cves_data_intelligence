        "description": "SYMFONY IS A PHP FRAMEWORK FOR WEB AND CONSOLE APPLICATIONS AND A SET OF REUSABLE PHP COMPONENTS. PRIOR TO VERSIONS 5.4.51, 6.4.33, 7.3.11, 7.4.5, AND 8.0.5, THE SYMFONY PROCESS COMPONENT DID NOT CORRECTLY TREAT SOME CHARACTERS (NOTABLY `=`) AS \u201cSPECIAL\u201d WHEN ESCAPING ARGUMENTS ON WINDOWS. WHEN PHP IS EXECUTED FROM AN MSYS2-BASED ENVIRONMENT (E.G. GIT BASH) AND SYMFONY PROCESS SPAWNS NATIVE WINDOWS EXECUTABLES, MSYS2\u2019S ARGUMENT/PATH CONVERSION CAN MIS-HANDLE UNQUOTED ARGUMENTS CONTAINING THESE CHARACTERS. THIS CAN CAUSE THE SPAWNED PROCESS TO RECEIVE CORRUPTED/TRUNCATED ARGUMENTS COMPARED TO WHAT SYMFONY INTENDED. IF AN APPLICATION (OR TOOLING SUCH AS COMPOSER SCRIPTS) USES SYMFONY PROCESS TO INVOKE FILE-MANAGEMENT COMMANDS (E.G. `RMDIR`, `DEL`, ETC.) WITH A PATH ARGUMENT CONTAINING `=`, THE MSYS2 CONVERSION LAYER MAY ALTER THE ARGUMENT AT RUNTIME. IN AFFECTED SETUPS THIS CAN RESULT IN OPERATIONS BEING PERFORMED ON AN UNINTENDED PATH, UP TO AND INCLUDING DELETION OF THE CONTENTS OF A BROADER DIRECTORY OR DRIVE. THE ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT WHEN UNTRUSTED INPUT CAN INFLUENCE PROCESS ARGUMENTS (DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, E.G. VIA REPOSITORY PATHS, EXTRACTED ARCHIVE PATHS, TEMPORARY DIRECTORIES, OR USER-CONTROLLED CONFIGURATION). VERSIONS 5.4.51, 6.4.33, 7.3.11, 7.4.5, AND 8.0.5 CONTAINS A PATCH FOR THE ISSUE. SOME WORKAROUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. AVOID RUNNING PHP/ONES OWN TOOLING FROM MSYS2-BASED SHELLS ON WINDOWS; PREFER CMD.EXE OR POWERSHELL FOR WORKFLOWS THAT SPAWN NATIVE EXECUTABLES. AVOID PASSING PATHS CONTAINING `=` (AND SIMILAR MSYS2-SENSITIVE CHARACTERS) TO SYMFONY PROCESS WHEN OPERATING UNDER GIT BASH/MSYS2. WHERE APPLICABLE, CONFIGURE MSYS2 TO DISABLE OR RESTRICT ARGUMENT CONVERSION (E.G. VIA `MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL`), UNDERSTANDING THIS MAY AFFECT OTHER TOOLING BEHAVIOR.",
