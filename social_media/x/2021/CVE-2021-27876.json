THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN A CLIENT AND AN AGENT REQUIRES SUCCESSFUL AUTHENTICATION, WHICH IS TYPICALLY COMPLETED OVER A SECURE TLS COMMUNICATION. HOWEVER, DUE TO A VULNERABILITY IN THE SHA AUTHENTICATION SCHEME, AN ATTACKER IS ABLE TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND COMPLETE THE AUTHENTICATION PROCESS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE CLIENT CAN EXECUTE DATA MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL COMMANDS ON THE AUTHENTICATED CONNECTION. BY USING CRAFTED INPUT PARAMETERS IN ONE OF THESE COMMANDS, AN ATTACKER CAN ACCESS AN ARBITRARY FILE ON THE SYSTEM USING SYSTEM PRIVILEGES.",
