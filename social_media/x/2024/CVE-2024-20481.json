        "description": "A VULNERABILITY IN THE REMOTE ACCESS VPN (RAVPN) SERVICE OF CISCO ADAPTIVE SECURITY APPLIANCE (ASA) SOFTWARE AND CISCO FIREPOWER THREAT DEFENSE (FTD) SOFTWARE COULD ALLOW AN UNAUTHENTICATED, REMOTE ATTACKER TO CAUSE A DENIAL OF SERVICE (DOS) OF THE RAVPN SERVICE.\r\n\r THIS VULNERABILITY IS DUE TO RESOURCE EXHAUSTION. AN ATTACKER COULD EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY BY SENDING A LARGE NUMBER OF VPN AUTHENTICATION REQUESTS TO AN AFFECTED DEVICE. A SUCCESSFUL EXPLOIT COULD ALLOW THE ATTACKER TO EXHAUST RESOURCES, RESULTING IN A DOS OF THE RAVPN SERVICE ON THE AFFECTED DEVICE. DEPENDING ON THE IMPACT OF THE ATTACK, A RELOAD OF THE DEVICE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RESTORE THE RAVPN SERVICE.
